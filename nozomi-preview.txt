Nozomi UI Library • Private Snapshot - Beta
====================================

Access
------
Nozomi is a private UI library maintained by austin. if you're interested in a
demo or collaboration, reach out at hello@austinxyz.lol with your project goals.

What makes Nozomi different
---------------------------
- theme presets with live tween updates (Sakura Dark, Nord, Soft Mint, etc.)
- asset manager that caches Lucide icons via executor-friendly APIs
- dynamic island loader plug-in with stats telemetry + animations
- full toolkit: toggles, sliders, dropdowns, color picker, confirm dialogs
- executor-aware caching and Discord-style modal UX

Integration Outline
-------------------
Once access is granted, you'll receive a secure loader endpoint and usage notes
covering:
- creating a themed window (`UILibrary.new`)
- wiring core components (toggles, sliders, dropdowns)
- connecting the dynamic island to loader telemetry
- updating themes on the fly via `ApplyPreset`
